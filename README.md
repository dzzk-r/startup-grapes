## üß† What is this?

A minimalist infographic built as a data-driven interactive map.  
Each circle is a real tech company in Israel. The bigger the grape, the more revenue per employee. Click to see valuation, HQ, year founded, stock info, and source.

Inspired by **data journalism**, **VC research**, and a desire to make financial insight feel tangible.

## üöÄ Motivation

As a former DevOps & Product engineer at NCR and an enthusiast in ML/AI infrastructure,  
I wanted to analyze and visualize which Israeli companies truly scale efficiently ‚Äî not just raise money.

This project is also a warm-up to more serious ML+Data Viz efforts.
