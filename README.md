## 🧠 What is this?

A minimalist infographic built as a data-driven interactive map.  
Each circle is a real tech company in Israel. The bigger the grape, the more revenue per employee. Click to see valuation, HQ, year founded, stock info, and source.

Inspired by **data journalism**, **VC research**, and a desire to make financial insight feel tangible.

## 🚀 Motivation

I wanted to analyze and visualize which Israeli companies truly scale efficiently — not just raise money.

This project is also a warm-up to more serious ML+Data Viz efforts.
